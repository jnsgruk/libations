# Libations

This is a simple static website for hosting cocktail recipes. The actual site is built using [Hugo]
and served over Tailscale (using [tsnet]) by a simple Go binary that embeds the page. The page is
designed to be viewed on a mobile - it works _okay_ on bigger screens, but I've not yet made that
look "right".

The page is styled with the excellent [Vanilla Framework], because that's what I had to hand.
Despite appearances, this site has nothing to do with [Canonical] ðŸ˜‰.

Cocktail recipes are served up from a JSON file containing the recipes. The format is listed in a
section below. There is an example [included](./webui/data/drinks.json).

## Usage

### Using Nix

```bash
# Enter the development shell
nix develop

# Run the package
nix run .#libations
```

### Otherwise...

Before building you must have [Hugo], and [Go] installed.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jnsgruk/libations

# Build the static site with Hugo
go generate

# Optional - if not provided you'll be prompted
export TS_AUTHKEY="tskey-auth-aBcdEfghIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz"

# Run the application
go run main.go
```

For iterating on the web interface, it can be quicker to just use Hugo:

```bash
cd webui

hugo serve --minify
```

## Recipe File Format

The [drinks.json](./webui/data/drinks.json) file is a list of JSON objects, where each object
represents a drink:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 7,
    "name": "Adderly",
    "base": ["Bourbon"],
    "glass": ["Coup"],
    "method": ["Shake"],
    "ice": [],
    "ingredients": [
      { "name": "Orange Bitters", "measure": "1", "unit": "dash" },
      { "name": "Lemon", "measure": "20", "unit": "ml" },
      { "name": "Sugar", "measure": "5", "unit": "ml" },
      { "name": "Maraschino", "measure": "15", "unit": "ml" },
      { "name": "Bourbon", "measure": "45", "unit": "ml" }
    ],
    "garnish": [],
    "notes": "I like this one, good with frozen Bourbon"
  }
]
```

## TODO

- [ ] Implement a filter bar to filter by ingredient, method, garnish, etc.
- [ ] Provide a means for adding/removing/editing drinks
